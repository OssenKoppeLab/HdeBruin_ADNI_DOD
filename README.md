**In this folder you can find the R code for our manuscript 'Amyloid-Î² and tau deposition in traumatic brain injury: A study of Vietnam War veterans'**


The code loads locally processed amyloid-PET and tau-PET data (within 200 Schaefer regions) from ADNI DOD for 103 male Vietnam War veterans, combined with demographic and clinical data coming from various ADNI DOD files:

#### PTDEMOG.csv
#### APOERES.csv
#### TELSCRN.csv
#### TBISERIES.csv
#### TBISRIESFU.csv
#### RECTBIINJ.csv
#### DXSUM.csv
#### MMSE.xlsx
#### PTSDELG.csv


You can find the necessary steps to generate relevant variables using these files (such as 'TBI_status') in the methods section of our manuscript. The provided code mainly includes the steps to conduct our main analyses.

The code makes use of a dependency called 'rendering_function_17N.R', which is also included in this folder.
